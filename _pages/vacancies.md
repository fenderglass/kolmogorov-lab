Multiple **postdoc** and **PhD student** positions are available under the supervision of [Dr. Mikhail Kolmogorov](../) at the NIH's National Cancer Institute. 
The Kolmogorov Lab is part of the [Cancer Data Science Laboratory](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory), 
a new initiative dedicated to translational omics research and tightly integrated with basic and translational projects at the NCI.
The general focus of Dr. Kolmogorov's group is **computational genomics** - algorithms, mathematical models and tools 
aimed to answer fundamental questions about living systems through the analysis of large-scale genomic data.

The group is currently seeking applicants with an interest in developing and/or applying computational 
methods for cancer genomics and metagenomics. Possible projects include but not limited to: analysis of complex chromosomal
rearrangements in cancer, haplotype-resolved assembly of complex polyploid genomes, deconvolution
of complex metagenomic communities, genome graph representations, genomic analysis of large patient cohort data. 
We are also open to other computational projects candidates would like to propose, as long as they fit our general direction.

Computational research is well-recognized within NIH and NCI, providing many opportunities for on-campus collaboration.
We collaborate closely with [NIH CARD center](https://card.nih.gov/), [T2T](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup) 
and [HPRC](https://humanpangenome.org/) consortia, [UCSC Genomics Institute](https://genomics.ucsc.edu/), and many others.

The funding for these positions is stable and offers great flexibility to pursue research in computational biology. 
The successful candidate will have access to extensive high-performance computing resources ([BioWulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/)), the NCI core facilities, 
and the NIH Clinical Center. The typical starting stipend for a computational postdoc is approximately $70k per year and includes family health insurance. 
Answers to some frequently asked questions can be found here: [NIH Postdoc FAQs](https://www.training.nih.gov/resources/faqs/postdoc_irp). 
PhD training can also be arranged through most nearby universities, such as the University of Maryland, via the 
[NIH Graduate Partnerships Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp).

Applicants must possess strong English, programming, and analytical skills. 
Past experience in computational genomics is preferred but not required.

**To apply.** Interested applicants should submit their CV to: <fenderglass@gmail.com>.

**About the NCI Center for Cancer Research.**
The Center for Cancer Research (CCR) is home to nearly 250 basic and clinical research groups located on two campuses just outside of Washington, D.C. CCR is part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and makes up the largest component of the research effort at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Centrally supported by long-term funding and a culture of complete intellectual freedom, CCR scientists are able to pursue the most important and challenging problems in cancer research. We collaborate with academic and commercial partners and advocacy groups across the world in efforts to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer and HIV/AIDS. The CCR research portfolio covers the full spectrum of biological and biomedical research. Our work ranges from basic to translational and clinical, and our clinical trials are conducted in the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest hospital dedicated to clinical research that offers a robust infrastructure to support CCR’s patients on an estimated 250 open studies. The success of CCR is grounded in an exceptionally strong discovery research program that provides the foundation for the seamless translation of insights from bench to bedside.

**Bethesda.**
Bethesda is one of the most highly educated communities in the United States and has a nationally renowned school system. The city is a thriving suburban center close to Washington, D.C., and home to many restaurants, retailers and a flourishing arts and entertainment district.

*DHHS, NIH and NCI are equal opportunity employers. The NCI and CCR are deeply committed to diversity of thought, equity and inclusion and encourage applications from qualified women, underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities.*
