The Kolmogorov Lab is officially kicking off in January 2022 at the [National Cancer Institute](https://ccr.cancer.gov/), 
as a part of the [Cancer and Data Science Laboratory](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory).

The general focus of our research will be computational genomics - algorithms, mathematical models and tools 
aimed to answer fundamental questions about living systems through the analysis of large-scale genomic data.

Members of our group have developed many widely-used algorithms for sequence assembly and analysis
([Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [metaFlye](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00971-x),
[Ragout](https://github.com/fenderglass/Ragout)). We have extensive experience in long-read DNA sequencing
and recently contributed to completion of the [human genome sequence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.26.445798v1) 
as a part of the [T2T Consortium](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup).
In another recent work, we used long-read metagenomics to recover 
[hundreds of nearly-complete bacterial chromosomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.442591v1.abstract)
from a complex heterogeneous environments. 


The lab is run by [Mikhail Kolmogorov](people/) who is a Stadtman Investigator at the NCI.
