Welcome to the Kolmogorov Lab
-----------------------------

<figure><img src="assets/images/NihBldg10.jpg" alt="NIH campus" style="width:100%;" align="left"/></figure>

The Kolmogorov Lab is officially kicking off in January 2022 at the [National Cancer Institute](https://ccr.cancer.gov/), 
as a part of the [Cancer and Data Science Laboratory](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory).

The general focus of our research will be computational genomics and metagenomics - 
algorithms, mathematical models and tools aimed to answer fundamental questions about living systems 
through the analysis of large-scale genomics data.

Members of our group have developed many widely-used algorithms for genomic analysis
([Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [metaFlye](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00971-x),
[Ragout](https://github.com/fenderglass/Ragout)). We specialize in long-read DNA sequencing
and recently contributed to completion of the [human genome sequence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.26.445798v1) 
as a part of the [T2T Consortium](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup).
In a separate collaboration with [USDA](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/clay-center-ne/marc/gbahru/people/timothy-smith/), 
we showed that long-read metagenomic sequencing can recover 
[hundreds of nearly-complete bacterial genomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.442591v1.abstract)
from just a single sample. 


The lab is run by [Mikhail Kolmogorov](/people/) who is a tenure-track Stadtman Investigator at the NCI.
