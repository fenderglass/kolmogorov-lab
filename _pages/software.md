[Flye & metaFlye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)
>Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale assemblies. 
Flye also has a special mode for metagenome assembly.

[HapDup](https://github.com/fenderglass/hapdup) 
>HapDup (haplotype duplicator) is a pipeline to convert a haploid long read assembly into a dual diploid assembly.
The reconstructed haplotypes preserve heterozygous structural variants (in addition to small variants) and are locally phased.


---

[Ragout](https://github.com/fenderglass/Ragout)
>Ragout is a tool for chromosome-level scaffolding using multiple references. 
Given initial assembly fragments (contigs/scaffolds) and one or multiple related references (complete or draft), 
it produces a chromosome-scale assembly (as a set of scaffolds).

[dipdiff](https://github.com/fenderglass/dipdiff)
>dipdiff is a simple SV calling package for diploid assemblies

[maf2synteny](https://github.com/fenderglass/maf2synteny)
>A tool that postprocesses whole genome alignment (for two or more genomes) and produces coarse-grained synteny blocks.
