Mikhail (Misha) Kolmogorov
--------------------------

*Stadtman Investigator*

<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wc5LHGcAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>.

Before joining the NCI, Misha was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Santa Cruz, 
supervised by [Benedict Paten](https://cglgenomics.ucsc.edu/).
Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC San Diego, 
co-supervised by [Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/) and 
[Pavel Pevzner](https://bioalgorithms.ucsd.edu/). He completed my PhD in September 2019 
in the [Computer Science and Engineering Depertment](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) 
at UC San Diego, under the mentorship of Pavel Pevzner.

His research focus is bioinformatics. In particular, he is interested in algorithms
for genome assembly using long reads, which enable high-quality reconstruction
of the human genome sequence. I also work on tools for comparative genomics and computational proteomics.
