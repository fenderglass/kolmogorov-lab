Before joining the NCI, Misha was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Santa Cruz, 
supervised by [Benedict Paten](https://cglgenomics.ucsc.edu/).
Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC San Diego, 
co-supervised by [Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/) and 
[Pavel Pevzner](https://bioalgorithms.ucsd.edu/). He completed his PhD in September 2019 
in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) 
at UC San Diego, under the mentorship of Pavel Pevzner.
Previously, he received his M.Sc. in bioinformatics from St. Peterburg University of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Misha is interested in building fundamental algorithms
and tools for genomic data analysis. He is the lead developer
of the widely-used [Flye assembler](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) for long-read
DNA sequencing data. His most recent research aimed to characterize
[complex metagenomic communities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.442591v1.abstract) 
using long-read sequencing.
