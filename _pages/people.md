Before joining the NCI, Misha was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Santa Cruz, 
supervised by [Benedict Paten](https://cglgenomics.ucsc.edu/).
Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC San Diego, 
co-supervised by [Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/) and 
[Pavel Pevzner](https://bioalgorithms.ucsd.edu/). He completed my PhD in September 2019 
in the [Computer Science and Engineering Depertment](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) 
at UC San Diego, under the mentorship of Pavel Pevzner.

Misha is interested in building fundamental algorithms
and tools for genomic data analysis. He is the lead developer
of the widely-used [Flye asembler](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) for long-read
DNA sequencing data. His most recent research aimed to characterize
[complex metagenominc communities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.442591v1.abstract) 
using long-read sequencing.
